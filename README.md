# Static Analysis #
In this homework, you will implement a static analysis tool to detect bugs in source code. Static 
analysis tools are commonly used in the continuous software delivery process to ensure quality 
of your software. 

You will implement this tool in Java using Spoon, an open-source tool for source code analysis 
and transformation. To understand the Spoon API, refer to the documentation linked below:
- Spoon, an open-source tool for source code analysis and transformation in Java.
To understand the API, you need to read about Spoon API, visitor pattern and abstract syntax 
tree.
- Link to documentation for Spoon: https://inria.hal.science/hal-01078532/document

You do not need to read all the documentation. It is only here for reference. 
Additionally, some of the patterns you work on will appear in an upcoming assignment. By 
completing this homework, you will cover some of the required work for that assignment.
